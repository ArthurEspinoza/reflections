When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When i want to share the project with all the people or if multiple members participated on the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay-up-to-date with your remote respository?

  Because accidents always happen and maybe Git push things that maybe you may not want, 
and if you dou manually you can always check what you are going to push

Describe the differences between forks, clone, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

  Forks: Only gives you the coppy of the repo but no pushing into the original. I only 
use this for example if i want to use code from another person into my project, to have a 
base.
  Clone: Clones everythin. If I will work with a teammate and he or she has the repo 
already with some progress.
  Branches: To exxperiment with my project, or if i am testing a new feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
locally?

  Because you can always have a back-up
