When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When i want to share the project with all the people or if multiple members participated on the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay-up-to-date with your remote respository?

  Because accidents always happen and maybe Git push things that maybe you may not want, 
and if you dou manually you can always check what you are going to push
