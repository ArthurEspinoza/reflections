What happens when you initialized a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
	When you initialized a repo Git creates a .git file hidden in your workspace
	And why i need to do it, it is because i need to work with my own commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you

	The staging area is like the the midle point of your project where you can only add the snapshot 
	files no the files perse and it is different from Git because it not contains neither the files
	or the commits
